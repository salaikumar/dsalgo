Substring
Max. Score100
Maggu has just joined play school. His teacher taught him A,a,B,b,C,c. He is much fascinated with these letters and now he is looking only for those strings which contains these letters only. But as i said he is a little guy he cant calculate the number of such sub-strings alone. So,he asked you (The String Calculator) for help.

Help little Maggu as i am not there to help him.

Refer test cases for better understanding

INPUT:

First line of input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of a single line containing string denoting maggu's search space.

OUTPUT:

Output consists of t lines each containing number of such substrings which contains only letters from the maggu's set of characters.

CONSTRAINTS:

t<=10

|strlen(str)| < =10^5

Candy Distribution 2
Max. Score100
It is Jawa's birthday today. His each friend tells him the least number of toffees he wants. Later, his friends together decided that if he is able to satisfy the condition of atleast one of his friends than they will buy him a $1000 gift.
You have to help Jawa to decide the minimum number of toffees he need to buy to satisfy his friends conditions. This minimum number of toffees in any possible distribution should satisfy his friends condition.

Input: 
First line contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting number of his friends.
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the least number of toffees his each friend want.

Output: 
For each test case output single integer denoting minimum number of toffees he needs to buy to satisfy the condition.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=N<=100000
1<=Ai<=1000000000

IRCTC
Max. Score100
Good news , You have a chance to work in IRCTC as a software developer . Applications are required with a program for railway sites . sid of a station is a something which uniquely defines it . Given N station's sid from 1 to N and distance between any two stations , if any person wants to go from station having sid A to another station C via station B as early as possible , where time is directly proportional to distance . What you have to do is to print the total distance and path to be covered by train if it exists , otherwise print "No Train Found.". If a railway line connects station A to B with distance d than it means it will also connects station B to station A with same distance d .

Input
First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. It is followed by T tests cases. Each test case's first line contains two integers N and k , where N is the number of stations having sid from 1 to N and k is the number of railway lines which connects stations. Following k lines each contain three numbers a , b and d which represents station having sid a connects station b and distance between them is d . After that a line follows with number A , B , C , where A represents sid of the source station , C the destination station and B is the station via which person wants to go.

Output
For each test case , If there exists no paths as described in problem print "No Train Found." otherwise in first line print the total distance and in second line path to be covered .

Constraints
1 <= t <= 100
1 <= k <= 100000
3 <= N <= 100000
1 <= A,B,C <= N
1 <= d <= 10000000

Maggu is the most brilliant student in his class .He has given some maths assignment by his maths teacher. But, today he has to go to Lissa's Birthday party. Therefore, he can't get enough time to complete his assignment. So, Can you provide him a helping hand. He asked you because you are second most intelligent student from the same class.

Assignment problem:
Given a set of integers containing n elements (A[i] where 1<=i<=n) and thereafter T question each containing single integer Z . you need to tell whether it is possible to take any subset from the original set such that sum of the elements in it when XOR'd with Z results in zero.

INPUT:
first line of the input contains a single integer n denoting the number of elements in the set. Next line of input contains n space separated integers denoting elements of set. Next line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of question.Next T lines contains T integers Z describing each question.(one per line)

OUTPUT:
output consists of T lines each containing either "Yes" or "No" (quotes for clarity) depending upon existence of such subset.

CONSTRAINTS:
n<=100
A[i]<=1000 
T<=1000000
z<=1000000
